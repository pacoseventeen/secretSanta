# Secret Santa
Code and test data for a secret santa script/bot. 

This is a slack bot designed to help organize a group
anonymous gift exchange, somtimes called a Secret Santa.
It collects the data via Slack, eventually partners 
everyone up, lets everyone know who they'll be a Santa
for, and then destroys the data. It all happens
autonomously and no humans ever know the secret.

The included usersExampleFile.json shows the planned
formatting for the users file.
