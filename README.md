# Secret Santa
Code and test data for a secret santa script. 

The script reads in a JSON formatted file containing 
the list of participants and their contact info. It
then anonymizes the data, partners everyone up, sends
the mailer their recipients name and address over Slack,
and then destroys the data. The goal is for the secret
to remain a secret to every single person involved.
